## Square-The-Box

This is a design and technology project which translates a Josef Albers color theory painting in to a 3D artifact. The artifact gets data from the audience and creates a color scheme output according to the input.

The code for the project can be found under the file **"Odd pot(1)"** - I don't rename my files after p5 apha editor names it. 

Rhino sketch of the product is a one on one size model **"Prototype.2.3dm"** 

Design inspiration : **"Homage to the Square" by Josef Albers**
